# Reel Cover Generator — Agent Skill

Generate professional, branded Instagram Reel cover images (9:16) from a video script. Designed for Arabic and English tech content creators.

**What it does:**
- Reads your reel script and extracts a punchy title (Arabic or English)
- Picks a matching visual theme (AI, cybersecurity, breaking news, etc.)
- Integrates your photo naturally into a cinematic cover
- Outputs a 9:16 portrait image ready to publish

## Prerequisites

This skill uses **Gemini image generation** to produce the cover. Make sure the [Gemini MCP server](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli-mcp) is installed and configured before using the skill.

## Installation

### Skills CLI (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, and more)

Any agent that supports the Skills CLI can install this skill:

```bash
npx skills add ismail9k/skill-reel-cover-generator
```

Verify it was installed:

```bash
npx skills list
```

### Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop doesn't have a Skills CLI, so install manually:

**Step 1 — Open the skill panel**

## Usage

Once installed, trigger the skill by:

- Dropping a script and asking for a **"reel cover"**
- Or running `/reel-cover-generator`

**The skill will:**
1. Analyze your script and extract a title and visual theme
2. Ask for your photo
3. Generate the cover via Gemini
4. Offer refinements if needed

**Language-aware:** Arabic scripts get Egyptian-dialect Arabic titles; English scripts get punchy English titles. The skill detects the language automatically.
