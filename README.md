# Reel Cover Generator — Agent Skill

Generate professional, branded Instagram Reel cover images (9:16) from a video script. Designed for Arabic and English tech content creators.

**What it does:**
- Reads your reel script, detects its language, and summarizes it
- Suggests **3 title options** (in the script's language) — pick one or write your own
- Suggests **3 subtitle options** — pick one, write your own, or skip it
- Picks a matching visual theme (AI, cybersecurity, breaking news, etc.)
- Shows you the **final image prompt** for review — copy it into another tool, or let Claude continue
- If you continue with Claude: asks for your photo, then generates a cinematic 9:16 cover via Gemini

> **Note:** All conversation with you happens in **English**. Only the cover text (title/subtitle) follows the script's language.

## Prerequisites

### Set up Gemini MCP

The generation phase requires [@houtini/gemini-mcp](https://github.com/houtini/gemini-mcp) to be configured as an MCP server in Claude Code:

```bash
npm install -g @houtini/gemini-mcp
```

Then register it in your Claude Code MCP config — either globally in `~/.claude/settings.json` or per-project in `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gemini": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@houtini/gemini-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "GEMINI_API_KEY": "your-gemini-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Code after saving so it picks up the new MCP server. See the [@houtini/gemini-mcp docs](https://github.com/houtini/gemini-mcp) for the full configuration reference and supported env vars.

## Installation

### Using `claude install-skill` (recommended)

If you're on a recent Claude Code version, you can install the skill directly from GitHub:

```bash
claude install-skill github.com/ismail9k/claude-skill-reel-cover-generator
```

### Using Skills CMD

Any agent that supports the Skills CLI can install this skill:

```bash
npx skills add ismail9k/claude-skill-reel-cover-generator
```

Verify it was installed:

```bash
npx skills list
```

### Manually (no command line)

If you're not comfortable with the terminal, you can install the skill by copying the files into Claude's skills folder:

1. **Download the skill**
   - Go to [https://github.com/ismail9k/skill-reel-cover-generator](https://github.com/ismail9k/skill-reel-cover-generator)
   - Click the green **Code** button → **Download ZIP**
   - Unzip the downloaded file — you'll get a folder named `skill-reel-cover-generator`

2. **Open the Claude skills folder**
   - **macOS:** Open Finder, press `Cmd + Shift + G`, paste `~/.claude/skills` and press Enter
   - **Windows:** Open File Explorer, paste `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\skills` in the address bar and press Enter
   - If the `skills` folder doesn't exist yet, create it

3. **Move the skill into place**
   - Drag the unzipped `skill-reel-cover-generator` folder into the `skills` folder
   - The final path should look like: `~/.claude/skills/skill-reel-cover-generator/SKILL.md`

4. **Restart Claude**
   - Close and reopen Claude Code (or your Claude client) so it picks up the new skill

That's it — you can now use the skill by asking for a "reel cover" or running `/reel-cover-generator`.


## Usage

Once installed, trigger the skill by:

- Dropping a script and asking for a **"reel cover"**
- Or running `/reel-cover-generator`

**The skill will:**
1. Analyze your script — detect the language, summarize it, suggest a theme
2. Offer **3 title suggestions** — pick one or provide a custom title
3. Offer **3 subtitle suggestions** — pick one, provide a custom one, or skip it
4. Build the final image generation prompt and show it to you for review
5. Let you choose: **copy the prompt** to use elsewhere, or **continue with Claude**
6. If continuing: ask for your photo, generate the cover via Gemini, and offer refinements

**Language handling:** The skill talks to you in English. The cover text itself follows the script's language — Arabic scripts get Egyptian-dialect Arabic titles, English scripts get punchy English titles.
